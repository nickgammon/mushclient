Operating System
----------------

MUSHclient version 3.xx will run on: 

Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT 4, Windows NT 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista.

It will not run on Windows 3.1 or Windows 3.11, sorry! This is because the enhancements in version 3.x use various 32-bit features of the more recent Windows operating systems. If you wish to continue using Windows 3.1, then MUSHclient 1.04 is still a very fast, reliable MUD client.

It should work on Linux running Wine. See: http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=8380
